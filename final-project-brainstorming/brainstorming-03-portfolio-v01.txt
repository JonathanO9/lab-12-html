More about me

Basketball- I like to watch basketball, whether its the NBA , NCAA (College basketball), or even highschool basketball amongst the most interesting prospects for the future. I don't play it anymore but due to the fact I played and watched it for most of my kid and teenage years I will always be interested in it.

Video Games- Come on now, what young male wasn't addicted to some sort of video game at one point? My favorite games are Nba 2k which a new version releases everu year that peaks my interest, and Fortnite , another game that I enjoy due to its versatily and ability to be different from other games. I have played these games for a while and have developed high skill which has led me to other connections outside of it to benefit me.

Fashion- I have always liked being up to date and getting new fashion trends. Since a kid I've always liked the newest shoes espescially Jordan brand. As I have gotten older It's still one of my main interests because I always like to be a very fresh/nice wearing person when it comes to clothes and shoes.
